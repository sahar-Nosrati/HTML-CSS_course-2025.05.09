- HTML -> 
  - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
  - HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
  - HTML describes the structure of a Web page
  - HTML consists of a series of elements
  - HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
  - HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

explanation of simple HTML document -> 
  - The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
  - The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
  - The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
  - The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
  - The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.


- HTML element -> An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag
- point -> Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

- note -> Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag! 

- <!DOCTYPE html> declaration -> present the type of the page and helps browser to display web page correctly. It appers once at top of the script 

- Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
- <img src="" alt="">
- HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
- HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
- The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed

- specify the URL in the src attribute:
  -  Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website
  -  Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name.

- Attributes -> 
  - All HTML elements can have attributes
  - Attributes provide additional information about elements
  - Attributes are always specified in the start tag
  - Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

- href attribute -> The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute provides us specified the URL that our page  goes to this link 
- src attribute -> The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed
- The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels)
- The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

- lang attribute inside the <html> tag ->  to declare the language of the Web
- points -> Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

- title attribute -> some extra information about an element

- best practice for attribute ->
  - to lowecase
  - inside single or duble qutes (double qutes is better)

- HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
- Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

- A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
- <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page  (hr -> horizontal rules)
- <br> element defines a line break
- <pre> -> fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks

- style attribute -> add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more -> syntax -> 
  - <tagname style="property:value;">
